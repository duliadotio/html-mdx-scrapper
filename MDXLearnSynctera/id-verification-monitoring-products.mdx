# Identity verification and monitoring



## Synctera Know Your Customer (KYC)

Easily verify that your customers are who they say they are

Banks expect their FinTech partners to meet Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance requirements in adherence to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). However, establishing KYC processes is no simple task. Managing KYC processes, inefficiencies and inaccuracies can slow down the customer onboarding process and potentially lead to increased rates of financial crime.

Synctera KYC streamlines compliance processes using automated workflows. Our solution is purpose-built and preconfigured to meet all the unique regulatory requirements of FinTechs and their bank partners.

### Benefits

Prevent fraud proactively: Ensure compliance with your bank partner’s KYC processes and protect against fraudulent accounts from the very start

Remove friction to achieve growth quickly: Accelerate customer onboarding, enhance customer experience, and achieve faster growth in monthly active users

### Key features

Identity verification: Verify the identity of a customer using 400+ data sources

Risk scoring: Receive a risk score on how individual fields (email, phone number, address) correlate to accurately identifying the customer

Reason codes: View a detailed description for why a KYC check was accepted, declined or flagged for review

Synthetic identity protection: Identify and protect against the use of fake identities

Rerun KYC when customer's personal information changes: Keep KYC up to date by opting into this feature. You may choose to have KYC rerun automatically whenever your customers update their personal information, or you may initiate reruns yourself via Synctera's KYC API.

Regulatory dashboards: View a range of metrics and reports for auditing and compliance purposes

### How it works

## Synctera KYC Document Verification

Verify IDs and selfies as needed during customer onboarding



When onboarding new customers, in certain cases you may need to verify customer IDs or selfies. For example, a customer may not have a Social Security Number or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number. Or, your Know Your Customer (KYC) system may have flagged the customer for review. In these cases, you can use Synctera KYC Document Verification to validate that identity documents are real and accurate, and to compare them with user-entered data. Synctera KYC Document Verification also performs “liveness” checks on selfies to ensure that the person is real and physically present, and when needed, compares a selfie to the image on an identity document.

## Synctera Know Your Business (KYB)

Verify and monitor business customers

If you provide financial products or services to business customers, you are obligated to comply with a range of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations that require you to assess these customers, at onboarding and throughout the entire customer lifecycle, to make sure that they are legitimate, not sanctioned by the U.S. government, and not on any watchlists.

Know Your Business (KYB) processes today are often slow and require manually reviewing and tracking documentation in non-centralized systems. This makes it hard to scale B2B financial products or services without hiring additional compliance staff.

### Benefits

### Key features

Synctera Know Your Business (KYB) is an automated solution that helps you determine whether businesses should be allowed to open and maintain accounts with you. Synctera KYB assesses the riskiness of business customers - and of people connected to those businesses - with Accept/Review/Decline outcomes provided in 10 seconds to five minutes. A case is created in Synctera Cases for the Review/Decline outcomes.
