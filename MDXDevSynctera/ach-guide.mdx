# ACH Payments

[Suggest Edits](/edit/ach-guide)

# Overview

[](#overview)

If you‚Äôre building a service that will enable your customers to send and accept
payments, issue cards, or transfer money between accounts at different
institutions, chances are you‚Äôll need ACH. ACH is a one-stop shop for a
variety of payment use cases. From recurring payments and payroll deposits to
online purchases and bill payment, ACH offers a fast and flexible way to send
money. 

Originally established in 1970, expanding support and innovation around ACH
payments has led it to become one of the most popular online payment rails in
the world.

## What is an ACH Transaction?

[](#what-is-an-ach-transaction)

An ACH transaction (often referred to as an ACH transfer) is an electronic,
bank-to-bank money transfer processed through the Automated Clearing House
(ACH) Network. You can think of the ACH Network as a postal service for ACH
files. Each file can contain up to 1000 ACH entries with each entry
representing a transaction being sent from one bank to another.

ACH transactions can be used to facilitate Person-to-person (P2P),
Business-to-consumer (B2C), and Business-to-business (B2B) payments and is a
convenient alternative to card networks, wire transfers, paper checks or cash.
In addition to their convenience, ACH transactions are reliable, inexpensive,
fast, and most importantly, safe. Most transfers are processed and settled
within 1-2 business day with zero cost to the consumer.

## How does Synctera support ACH?

[](#how-does-synctera-support-ach)

From the outside, the ACH workflow may seem simple but it‚Äôs actually quite
complex. This is where where Synctera comes in. Synctera works with your
sponsor bank to serve as your connection to the ACH network and supports
sending and accepting ACH transactions from other financial institutions.

In ACH terms, Synctera acts as the ODFI (Originating Depository Financial
Institution) when it comes to originating transactions and the RDFI
(Receiving Depository Financial Institution) when it comes to receiving them.
Thats means we take care of all the batch processing and file generation while
ensuring that all transaction are reflected in your customer account balances.

## What are the 2 types of ACH Transactions?

[](#what-are-the-2-types-of-ach-transactions)

Each ACH transaction involves 2 primary parties:

All transactions fall into one of two categories, debit (‚Äúpull‚Äù) or credit (‚Äúpush‚Äù). 

### Push (Credit)

[](#push-credit)

Determining if a transaction is a push or pull is always with respect to the
receiving account. For example, if Tom, a customer of Bank A wants to send
money to John, a customer of Bank B. Tom‚Äôs bank can originate an ACH push
transaction from his account to John‚Äôs account. The term ‚Äúpush‚Äù is used
interchangeably with ‚Äúcredit‚Äù. The result is a credit to John‚Äôs (the receiver)
account balance and a debit to Tom‚Äôs (the sender).

A real life use case for push transactions are the deposits that result from an
employee signing up for payroll direct deposit. Whenever payday rolls around,
the employer‚Äôs bank initiates a push/credit to the employee‚Äôs bank account.

### Pull (Debit)

[](#pull-debit)

Alternatively, if Tom want‚Äôs to request money from John, Tom‚Äôs bank can
originate an ACH pull request from his account to John‚Äôs. The term ‚Äúpull‚Äù is
used interchangeably with ‚Äúdebit‚Äù. The result is a debit to John‚Äôs account and
a credit to Tom‚Äôs. This is what occurs when users of a service sign up for
recurring bill payments. The service provider ends up debiting the customer‚Äôs
account via an ACH pull request. 

This is also the case when a banking customer deposits a check made out to
him/her by an account holder at another financial institution. Checks are
ultimately translated into pull request on the ACH network. The check contains
the account holders routing and account number which are the only pieces of
information required to initiate a credit or debit from an account at another
institution.

üìò

There is a difference between the direction of an ACH transaction and the
direction of money flow. The direction of the transaction refers to the
direction of the ACH message on the network. It always flows from the
originator to the receiver while the direction of money flow relates to which
account is receiving funds and which account is sending them. This means
there are 2 ways to achieve the same direction of money movement.

## Scenario

[](#scenario)

The desired result is to withdraw funds from an account at Bank A and
deposit them into an account at Bank B

### Option 1 (This is how customers fund their accounts)

[](#option-1-this-is-how-customers-fund-their-accounts)

Bank B sends an ACH debit / pull transaction requesting funds from the
account at Bank A:

### Option 2

[](#option-2)

Bank A sends an ACH credit / push transaction to send funds to the account
at Bank B.

## How are accounts funded using ACH?

[](#how-are-accounts-funded-using-ach)

Once your customers have an account setup, they‚Äôll need to fund their account
by originating an ACH pull/debit transaction to be sent to their account at
another institution. Synctera refers to this as an external account. 

[external account](doc:%7Bexternal-accounts-guide%7D)

If you have just created account B on the Synctera platform and you want to add
funds to it from account A at another financial institution, its natural to
assume that funding involves pushing funds from account A to account B.
Instead, funding your customers account involves originating an ACH debit/pull
transaction with your Synctera account in order to withdraw funds from the
external account. 

## How do I get started with sending/receiving ACH payments?

[](#how-do-i-get-started-with-sendingreceiving-ach-payments)

### Step 1: Customer Creation

[](#step-1-customer-creation)

1.1 Create a Customer

Any individual wanting to transact on the Synctera platform must be stored as a
customer in our system. Part of that includes completing the KYC process.
See the Customer guide for details.

[Customer guide](doc:%7Bcreate-a-personal-customer%7D)

### Step 2: Account Creation

[](#step-2-account-creation)

2.1 Create an Account

In order to send and receive ACH payments you will need to create an account
and associate it with your customer. Account Guide 

[Account Guide](doc:%7Bcreate-accounts-guide%7D)

2.2 Create an External Account

In order for your customers to fund their accounts they‚Äôll need to debit funds
from an account at another institution. You‚Äôll need to create an external
account on the Synctera platform which serves as the internal representation of
the account to be debited. External Account Guide

[External Account Guide](doc:%7Bexternal-accounts-guide%7D)

### Step 3: Send/Receive an ACH

[](#step-3-sendreceive-an-ach)

3.1 Send an ACH request

Once the external account has been verified, ACH transactions (credits and
debits) can be originated from your customer‚Äôs account. If you‚Äôre unsure what
values to set in your API request take a look at the documentation
here.

[here](ref:%7Baddtransactionout%7D)

3.2 Receive an ACH transaction

As long as your customer has an account that is both active and verified,
there is no work required by you or your customer to receive ACH transactions.
Synctera will process the incoming transaction and debit/credit the account
accordingly.

## What happens after I send an ACH request?

[](#what-happens-after-i-send-an-ach-request)

After you send a request to originate an ACH transaction, the transaction is
placed in a batch which, in turn, is placed in an ACH file to be sent out over
the network. Depending on the time that you originate the transaction there may
be some delay between the time the transaction is created and the time the file
is sent. This is done to align with the processing schedule
set by the federal reserve. The date the transaction is sent will ultimately
determine when funds are settled across accounts and institutions. It will also
have a bearing on if and when an ACH transaction can be returned by the
recipient.

[processing schedule](https://www.frbservices.org/resources/resource-centers/same-day-ach/fedach-processing-schedule.html)

The responsibilities and guidelines for participants in the ACH system are
determined by the National Automated Clearing House Association, better known
as NACHA. NACHA operates as the rule making body for all financial institutions
wanting to use the ACH system.

## What do I need to do to receive an ACH transaction?

[](#what-do-i-need-to-do-to-receive-an-ach-transaction)

Nothing. Unless an incoming transaction needs to be returned (see
Why would an ACH transaction be returned?),
no action is required. Synctera will process all debit and credits for any ACH
transactions that we receive on behalf of you or your customers. Check your
Synctera dashboard to view all ACH transaction that have been sent or received.
Synctera also supports webhooks to notify you of all ACH transactions.

[Why would an ACH transaction be returned?](#why-would-an-ach-transaction-be-returned)

## How long does it take to process an ACH transaction?

[](#how-long-does-it-take-to-process-an-ach-transaction)

The time it takes for the network to completely process an ACH transaction is
dependent on a number of variables. The operating schedule of the federal
reserve, the operating schedule of each bank, and the time of day the
transaction was created are all key factors in determining when a transaction
will settle. ‚ÄúSettle‚Äù. Integrators can influence the timing of an ACH
transaction by setting the is_same_day field to true when posting a request
to send a transaction.

`is_same_day`

`true`

However, even when sending ‚Äúsame day‚Äù ACH transfers, there are a couple things
to keep in mind:

[processing schedule](https://www.frbservices.org/resources/resource-centers/same-day-ach/fedach-processing-schedule.html)

## Why would an ACH transaction be returned?

[](#why-would-an-ach-transaction-be-returned)

ACH transactions can be returned for a variety of reasons. ‚ÄúInsufficient
funds‚Äù, ‚Äúinvalid account number‚Äù, ‚Äúaccount closed‚Äù are all fair game but but
many of the return reasons are not so obvious. NACHA guidelines specify
85 different codes
that may be associated with a returned transaction. The good news is that you
and your customers are likely to see only the most common ones. Synctera will
take care of processing any returned transaction and notify you of the
resolution via webhooks. In the event that a returned transaction requires your
immediate attention, you will be able to take action through the Synctera
dashboard. 

[85 different codes](https://engineering.gusto.com/how-ach-works-a-developer-perspective-part-2/#appendix)

The dashboard is also were you can generate returns from received ACH
transactions. While most transaction failures such as insufficient funds,
invalid account, etc., will result in automatic returns, you may occasionally
identify transactions that were not authorized and choose to manually initiate
a return.

## ACH same day vs non-same day cut-off times

[](#ach-same-day-vs-non-same-day-cut-off-times)

ACH (Debit/Credit) - External bank to Synctera account

üìò

Not all of our sponsor banks support 8:00 pm ET / 2:15 am ET exchange times

ACH Returns - External bank to Synctera account

## Example: Funding a customer account

[](#example-funding-a-customer-account)

To fund a customer account from an external bank account the Synctera API:

`
curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $apikey" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  https://api.synctera.com/v0/ach \
  --data-binary '
    {
      "risk": {
        "client_ip": "127.0.0.1"
      },
      "customer_id": "{CUSTOMER_ID}",
      "amount": 100,
      "currency": "USD",
      "receiving_account_id": "{EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_ID}", 
      "dc_sign": "debit", 
      "originating_account_id": "{ACCOUNT_ID}", 
      "reference_info": "Synctera test",
      "memo": "Synctera test"
    }'

`

It is important to note a few things in this example:

`receiving_account_id`

[External Account](doc:%7Bexternal-accounts-guide%7D)

`originating_account_id`

[Account](doc:%7Bcreate-accounts-guide%7D)

`dc_sign`
