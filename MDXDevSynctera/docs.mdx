# A Synctera Platform Overview for FinTechs

[](#a-synctera-platform-overview-for-fintechs)

You’re a developer about to integrate the Synctera platform with your application. Before you start, what is the Synctera platform anyway? What does it offer, and how do you work with it?

## The Synctera Platform in a Nutshell

[](#the-synctera-platform-in-a-nutshell)

The Synctera platform is a comprehensive set of cloud-based financial services that brings three types of businesses together:

Synctera provides a unified platform that manages interactions between FinTechs and sponsor banks. It consolidates a variety of essential services such as accounts and ledger, card issuance and management, money movement, and risk management under central control through a family of APIs and the Synctera Dashboard.

### FinTechs and Sponsor Banks

[](#fintechs-and-sponsor-banks)

The first step in a FinTech’s relationship with Synctera is onboarding to Synctera. During the onboarding process, Synctera helps determine the banking resources the FinTech requires, find a sponsor bank that can provide those resources, and works to establish a business relationship between both parties.

Once a FinTech has connected with a sponsor bank, the Synctera platform provides services that help the FinTech and sponsor bank communicate essential information to each other as they carry out business together. The FinTech can, for example, reconcile the transactions its customers carry out with the customers’ accounts held by the sponsor bank so that the FinTech and the bank’s records agree. Or the FinTech can communicate actions it takes to ensure compliance with banking laws so the sponsor bank knows that their mutual business doesn’t risk breaking those laws.

### Synctera Services

[](#synctera-services)

In addition to the connection between a sponsor bank and a Fintech, the Synctera platform services are implemented and provided by Synctera and our vendor partners. Synctera’s native services include setting up customers and accounts, reconciling FinTech transactions with a sponsor bank, reporting compliance activities, and so on.

Synctera depends on vendor partners to provide more specialized services that include creating debit cards, performing know-your-customer (KYC) checks on potential customers before signup, performing debit card transactions, and more. These vendor services are all available through the Synctera platform without requiring external setup, contract negotiation, or connections.

### Synctera Products

[](#synctera-products)

To use Synctera services, a FinTech subscribes to one or more Synctera products via the sponsor bank. Each product provides access to services that address a particular business case.

FinTechs can pick and choose products to fit their requirements. A FinTech that carries out its own KYC may, for example, opt not to use Synctera KYC products, but may decide to use Synctera ledger and card products to issue and manage debit cards.

Synctera offers products that provide, among other things:

## Platform Interfaces

[](#platform-interfaces)

The Synctera Platform provides two main interfaces to a FinTech:

[Synctera APIs](/reference)

Use the Synctera APIs to integrate Synctera services with your applications, then use the Synctera dashboard for executives, administrators, operators, and your customer care staff to work with those services. The dashboard lets you oversee and gain insights into your business.

### Synctera APIs

[](#synctera-apis)

The Synctera APIs are RESTful APIs. They include a set of basic service APIs:

[Customers API](/reference/customers)

[Accounts API](/reference/listaccounts)

[Reconciliations API](/reference/reconciliations)

A set of risk management APIs:

[KYC Verification API](/reference/kyckyb-verifications)

[Disclosures API](/reference/disclosures)

[Watchlist API](/reference/watchlist)

A set of money movement APIs:

[Transactions API](/reference/transactions)

A set of card management APIs:

[Cards API](/reference/cards)

[Card Transaction Simulations API](/reference/card-transaction-simulations)

Access to these APIs in production depends on the Synctera products to which you’re subscribed.

### The Synctera Dashboard

[](#the-synctera-dashboard)

The Synctera dashboard is a browser-based user interface that humans in both a FinTech and its sponsor bank can use to work with integrated Synctera features. The dashboard has three views:
