# Get Started

[](#section-)

Most Synctera APIs act on resources whose IDs are specified in requests. These resources must exist. This means there is a sequence to calling the APIs to get from a clean slate to a successful transaction.

This document is aimed at capturing that sequence, which is a reflection of a typical customer journey. We have provided the exact API details here but we strongly encourage you to read the Guides mentioned below to understand the dependencies, alternatives, configuration needs and additional information about these products.

You can also explore and try out the Postman collection once you have an API key.

[Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/synctera/workspace/synctera-public-workspace/collection/19487588-931708f8-bc42-4051-8a02-4e9104d984e4?action=share&creator=19487588)

# Before You Begin

[](#before-you-begin)

## Get an API Key

[](#get-an-api-key)

If you don't already have an API key, you will need one in order to call the APIs. If you have signed up for the t-minus10 program (click here for more details on t-minus10) you can self-serve an API key by following the "Sandbox" or "Live testing" links in the top navigation. If you are already working with the Synctera team, you an also reach out to your contact at Synctera to get an API key.

[click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qPYNx4Ij1el5lIKbfJcJttQJb4Ot9xny/view?usp=sharing)

Self-serve:

[https://app-sandbox.synctera.com/admin/developer-tools/api-keys](https://app-sandbox.synctera.com/admin/developer-tools/api-keys)

Once an API key is issued in Sandbox, you can immediately start calling the APIs below. In Live Testing or Production, your FinTech must first pass KYB.

## KYB Your FinTech

[](#kyb-your-fintech)

In Sandbox - you're done! KYB was automatically passed for your Sandbox workspace.

In Live Testing or Production, you need to have run a successful KYB on your Fintech if you want to issue cards or move money via ACH / Internal transfers.

If you are on t-minus 10, you need to do this by filling in Business information and Owner details and then Run KYB using the t-minus 10 platform.

[Business information](https://app.synctera.com/admin/my-fintech/address)

[Owner details](https://app.synctera.com/admin/my-fintech/owners)

[Run KYB](https://app.synctera.com/admin/my-fintech/kyb)

If you are not on t-minus10, your contact at Synctera will collect the required information to run KYB for you.

[Disclosures](/docs/record-disclosure-acceptance)

API: Create Disclosure

As part of this, you can also enroll the user for Watchlists.

Guide: KYC

[KYC](/docs/kyc-kyb-verification)

APIs:

[Verify a customer's identity](/reference/verify)

Account templates define basic characteristics of an account. This is a mandatory step to create an account.

You can also use Account Products which can be included in the account template to capture the Interest / Fee aspects of the account.

Guide: Accounts

[Accounts](/docs/create-accounts-guide)

APIs:

[Create an account template](/reference/createaccounttemplate)

[Create an account product](/reference/createaccountresourceproduct)

Accounts

Once a Customer is created, Verified, and an account template is created, you can now create an account for the customer / business.

You can use Account relationships to create further relationships on the accounts - e.g Joint Account Holder.

Guide: Accounts

[Accounts](/docs/create-accounts-guide)

APIs:

[Create an account](/reference/createaccount)

Internal Accounts

To move funds into a customer account, you would typically link a customer's external account and move funds from there. Alternatively, as a convenience in the sandbox environment, you can also create an internal account to do this. Internal accounts in production would typically be used for specific needs such as issuing promotional credits to your customers. To create an internal account, use this API.

API: Add internal accounts

[Add internal accounts](/reference/addinternalaccounts)

Move Funds with ACH

Once an external account is linked (or you created an internal account as above), you can move funds from an external account into the customer’s account at the Fintech.
