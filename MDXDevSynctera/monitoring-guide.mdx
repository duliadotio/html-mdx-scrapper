# Ongoing Monitoring

[Suggest Edits](/edit/monitoring-guide)

ðŸ“˜

At this time, monitoring enrollment for personal customers is only available in the Synctera Production environment.

By default, all customers are enrolled in ongoing monitoring. Contact your Synctera sales representative to have this feature disabled.

This guide is provided to showcase a manual implementation of ongoing monitoring.

In addition to the Customer Identification Program (CIP) requirements discussed in the KYC guide financial service providers are required to conduct ongoing monitoring of their customers.

[KYC guide](/docs/kyc-kyb-verifications)

Synctera's monitoring offering provides the ability to subscribe customers to monitoring of global list of sanctions and enforcement watchlists, Politically Exposed Person (PEP) sources, and adverse media screening.

### Prerequisites

[](#prerequisites)

This guide assumes that you have:

[personal customer](/docs/create-a-personal-customer)

[disclosure](/docs/disclosures)

[verified a customer](/docs/kyc-kyb-verifications)

### Monitoring subscriptions

[](#monitoring-subscriptions)

A monitoring subscription represents the customer's enrollment with one of Synctera's monitoring vendors (e.g. Socure, Middesk). A monitoring subscription contains a unique identifier, the identifier of the customer, and any additional metadata.

`{
  "id": "497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08",
  "person_id": "7ef75751-e372-4c12-9b02-b9e4b1faaac9",
  "creation_time": "2021-06-14T14:15:22Z",
  "last_updated_time": "2021-12-14T07:15:34Z",
  "metadata": {}
}
`

The expected path for integrating monitoring into your platform includes: (1) Creating a customer. (2) Creating the necessary disclosures. (3) Verifying the customer. (4) Creating a monitoring subscription.

By default, all customers are automatically enrolled in subscription monitoring. Contact your Synctera sales representative to have this feature disabled.

See the API reference for more information about monitoring subscriptions.

[API reference](/reference/createsubscription)

### Monitoring alerts

[](#monitoring-alerts)

When an alert is received for a customer (e.g. watchlist hit, Secretary of State filing, bankruptcy, etc.) a monitoring alert is created.

 A monitoring alert contains a unique identifier, the identifier of the customer, the type of alert, status, a list of URLs where you can find more information, and a vendor specific representation alert.

`{
  "id": "497f6eca-6276-4993-bfeb-53cbbbba6f08",
  "person_id": "7ef75751-e372-4c12-9b02-b9e4b1faaac9",
  "type": "WATCHLIST",
  "vendor_info": {
    "vendor": "SOCURE",
    "content_type": "application/json",
    "json": {}
  },
  "urls": [
    "https://example.com/alert-document-1",
    "https://example.com/alert-document-2"
  ],
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "creation_time": "2021-06-14T14:15:22Z",
  "last_updated_time": "2021-12-14T07:15:34Z",
  "metadata": {}
}
`

Every incoming customer monitoring alert will trigger a case to be created in the Synctera Case Manager so that their profile can be manually reviewed by a compliance officer.

[Synctera Case Manager](https://learn.synctera.com/docs/en/kyc-cases-fintechs)

See the API reference for more information about monitoring alerts.

[API reference](/reference/getalert)

### Integration Steps

[](#integration-steps)

### 1. Create a personal customer

[](#1-create-a-personal-customer)

First we start by creating a record for our new customer. We'll use the POST /persons endpoint to create a person.

`POST /persons`

[create a person](/reference/createperson)

`curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $apikey" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.synctera.com/v0/persons \
  --data-binary '
  {
    "first_name": "Christopher",
    "middle_name": "James",
    "last_name": "Albertson",
    "dob": "1985-06-14",
    "email": "[emailÂ protected]",
    "phone_number": "+16045551212",
    "ssn": "456-78-9999",
    "legal_address": {
      "address_line_1": "123 Main St.",
      "city": "Beverly Hills",
      "state": "CA",
      "postal_code": "90210",
      "country_code": "US"
    },
    "is_customer": true,
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  }'
`

[[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

For more information about creating and managing people consult the person guide.

[person guide](/docs/create-a-personal-customer)

### 2. Create a KYC data collection disclosure

[](#2-create-a-kyc-data-collection-disclosure)

Once we have our created customer, you will need to display a disclosure to your customer that you are collecting personal data that will be shared with a third-party for the purpose of verifying their identity. For this we use the disclosures resource.

[disclosures resource](/reference/createdisclosure)

`curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $apikey" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.synctera.com/v0/disclosures \
  --data-binary '
  {
    "person_id": "7ef75751-e372-4c12-9b02-b9e4b1faaac9",
    "type": "KYC_DATA_COLLECTION",
    "version": "1.0",
    "event_type": "ACKNOWLEDGED",
    "disclosure_date": "2022-03-17T17:04:34Z"
  }'
`

For more information about creating and managing disclosures consult the disclosure guide.

[disclosure guide](/docs/record-disclosure-acceptance)

### 3. Verify the customer

[](#3-verify-the-customer)

Now that we have a customer, and consent to collect and share their data we can verify this customer.

`curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $apikey" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.synctera.com/v0/verifications/verify \
  --data-binary '
  {
    "person_id": "7ef75751-e372-4c12-9b02-b9e4b1faaac9",
    "customer_ip_address": "184.233.47.237",
    "customer_consent": true
  }'
`

ðŸ“˜

Consent must come directly from the customer.

### 4. Enroll the customer in monitoring

[](#4-enroll-the-customer-in-monitoring)

Once the customer has been verified, we are able to create a monitoring subscription.

`curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $apikey" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.synctera.com/v0/monitoring/subscriptions \
  --data-binary '
  {
    "person_id": "7ef75751-e372-4c12-9b02-b9e4b1faaac9",
  }'
`
