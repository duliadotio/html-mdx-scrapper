# Balance Floor and Ceiling and Linked Accounts

[Suggest Edits](/edit/balance-floor-ceiling)

Accounts can have a minimum and maximum balance, referred to as the balance floor and balance ceiling. These attributes can be used to implement a number of features, including pool accounts.

## Balance Floor

[](#balance-floor)

An account's balance floor consists of two attributes:

`balance`

`linked_account_id`

The balance floor creates a lower limit for the available balance of that account. Any transaction that would put the available balance of the account below its balance floor triggers a just-in-time (JIT) funding transaction from the linked account in order to bring the balance back up to the floor.

## Balance Ceiling

[](#balance-ceiling)

The balance ceiling creates an upper limit for the available balance. Any transaction that would put the available balance of the account above its balance ceiling triggers a just-in-time (JIT) funding transaction (also known as a sweep transaction) to the linked account in order to bring the balance back down to the ceiling.

## Example Use Cases

[](#example-use-cases)

### Pool Account

[](#pool-account)

There are a number of use cases where you want an account that always has a zero balance, and gets its funds from another account. For example, you many have a single pool account containing the funds for multiple business expense cards. In this case, each card's account would be set up like:

`balance_floor: {
    "balance": 0,
    "linked_account_id": "{POOL_ACCOUNT_ID}"
}
balance_ceiling: {
    "balance": 0,
    "linked_account_id": "{POOL_ACCOUNT_ID}"
}
`

All credits and debits to any of the card accounts would flow through to the pool account. Refer to the Business Expense Cards for more details.
