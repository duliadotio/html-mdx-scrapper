# Lines of Credit (alpha)

[Suggest Edits](/edit/line-of-credit-guide)

A Line of Credit (LoC) account is used to offer credit to customers of a fintech. It allows a borrower to utilize funds, as needed, up to a predetermined limit. The borrower may then repay the funds and borrow again as needed.

## Application

[](#application)

In order to create a Line of Credit account, Fintechs and their customers need to setup and create a credit application. A credit application consists of an application status and application details. This allows the fintech to offer credit to their customer and record whether the extended credit offer has been accepted or denied by the customer.

After creating an application, the fintech or its customers can then proceed to use an account template to create an account. You can use the Accounts API to create and manage accounts.

[Accounts API](/docs/create-accounts-guide)

## Integration steps

[](#integration-steps)

The curl examples assume you have set up baseurl and apikey environment variables. See Base URL and Authentication for instructions. Some examples depend on identifiers generated by previous steps. These are indicated like {APPLICATION_ID}.

## Application Status Flow:

[](#application-status-flow)

The following diagram illustrates all the states the application could be in. Upon creation of the credit application, the status is APPLICATION_SUBMITTED and can flow to other states as seen in the following diagram.
Once the application is in CREDIT_ACCEPTED, a credit account is now allowed to be created.

`APPLICATION_SUBMITTED`

`CREDIT_ACCEPTED`

`%%{init: {"fontFamily": "sans-serif"}}%%
stateDiagram-v2
    APPLICATION_SUBMITTED --> CREDIT_APPROVED
    APPLICATION_SUBMITTED --> CREDIT_DENIED
    CREDIT_APPROVED --> CREDIT_ACCEPTED_BY_CUSTOMER
    CREDIT_APPROVED --> CREDIT_NOT_ACCEPTED_BY_CUSTOMER
`
