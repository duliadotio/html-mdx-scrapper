# MRDC

[Suggest Edits](/edit/create-mobile-deposit-guide)

MRDC is a process that allows users to deposit checks into their accounts without having to go to a branch or ATM.

Customers can submit deposits by taking an image of the check and submitting it online using the Synctera platform.
Synctera API provides mobile deposit endpoints. As a FinTech you'll have to
implement a feature that allows a customer to take a photo of a check to be deposited.

## Steps to submit a deposit

[](#steps-to-submit-a-deposit)

The curl examples assume you have set up baseurl and apikey environment variables.
See Base URL and Authentication for instructions.
Some examples depend on identifiers generated by previous steps. These are indicated like {PERSON_ID}.

`curl`

`baseurl`

`apikey`

[Base URL](/reference/environments)

[Authentication](/reference/authentication)

`{PERSON_ID}`

### 1. Prompt customers to take the front and back image of the check on their mobile phone

[](#1-prompt-customers-to-take-the-front-and-back-image-of-the-check-on-their-mobile-phone)

As a FinTech you'll have to add a feature on your application that allows users to take the front and back images of a deposit to be submitted.
After the user takes the front and back images of the check proceed to step 2

### 2. Upload images to Synctera

[](#2-upload-images-to-synctera)

`curl -X POST \
  $baseurl/v0/documents \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $apikey' \
  --form 'name="test"' \
  --form 'file=@"/path_to_image/front.jpeg"'
`

Synctera will return the following response:

`{
  "creation_time": "2022-05-17T17:45:51.552888Z",
  "description": "",
  "file_name": "{FILE_NAME}",
  "id": "{ID}",
  "last_updated_time": "2022-05-17T17:45:51.552888Z",
  "name": "back.jpeg"
}
`

`curl -X POST \
  $baseurl/v0/documents \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $apikey' \
  --form 'name="{FILE_NAME}"' \
  --form 'file=@"{PATH_TO_FILE}"' 
  
`

Synctera will return the following response:

`{
  "creation_time": "2022-05-17T17:45:51.552888Z",
  "description": "",
  "file": "{FILE}",
  "id": "{ID}",
  "last_updated_time": "2022-05-17T17:45:51.552888Z",
  "name": "{NAME}"
}
`

### 3. Submit Deposit

[](#3-submit-deposit)

`curl -X POST \

  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $apikey' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \

## Funds availability rules

[](#funds-availability-rules)

When the fintech and bank sign up for MRDC they can configure funds availability rule that allows portion of the amount to be available immediately and create a temporary hold with an effective release date  

## Compliance for MRDC

[](#compliance-for-mrdc)

To meet bank regulations, the fintech will be asked to share their image capture process with their partner bank. This may include providing a list of the libraries being used for the process and evidence that the check images are not being cached. In general, bank partners would like to ensure that images of checks are not stored for an extended period of time, if at all, and that any requests made with these images are done so securely.
