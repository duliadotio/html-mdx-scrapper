Jump to

This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Synctera Inc. (âSynctera,â âweâ, âusâ or âourâ) and how we handle personal information that we collect through our digital properties that link to this Privacy Policy, including our website (collectively, the âServiceâ), as well as through social media, our marketing activities, our events and other activities described in this Privacy Policy. 

We may provide additional or supplemental privacy policies to individuals for specific products or services that we offer at the time we collect personal information.

Our Service is designed for businesses and their representatives. We do not offer products or services for use by individuals for their personal, family, or household purposes. Accordingly, we treat all personal information we collect as pertaining to individuals in their capacities as business representatives and not their individual capacities.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent we process personal information in the role of a processor or service provider on behalf of our business customers. For detailed privacy information related to a customer or a customer affiliate who uses our products and services as the controller, please contact our customer directly. We are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those explained in this Privacy Policy.

Information you provide to us. Â Personal information you may provide to us through the Service or otherwise includes:

â Â  Â  Â Contact data, such as your first and last name, salutation, email address, mailing address, professional title and company name, and phone number.

â Â  Â  Â Transactional data, such as information relating to or needed to complete your orders on or through the Service, including order numbers and transaction history.

â Â  Â  Â Marketing data, such as your preferences for receiving our marketing communications and details about your engagement with them.

â Â  Â  Â Other data not specifically listed here, which we will use as described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.

Third-party sources. We may combine personal information we receive from you with personal information we obtain from other sources, such as:

â Â  Â  Â Public sources, such as government agencies, public records, social media platforms, and other publicly available sources.

Automatic data collection. Â We, our service providers, and our business partners may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Service, our communications and other online services, such as:

â Â  Â  Â Device data, such as your computerâs or mobile deviceâs operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G), and general location information such as city, state or geographic area.

â Â  Â  Â Online activity data, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, the website you visited before browsing to the Service, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times and duration of access, and whether you have opened our marketing emails or clicked links within them.

Cookies and similar technologies. Like many online services, we use the following technologies:

â Â  Â  Â Cookies, which are text files that websites store on a visitorâs device to uniquely identify the visitorâs browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand user activity and patterns, and facilitating analytics and online advertising.â Â  Â  Â Local storage technologies, like HTML5 and Flash, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications. 

â Â  Â  Â Web beacons, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email address was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked. 

Data about others. Users of the Service may have the opportunity to refer friends or other contacts to us and share their contact information with us. Please do not refer someone to us or share their contact information with us unless you have their permission to do so. 

## How we use your personal information

We may use your personal information for the following purposes or as otherwise described at the time of collection:

â Â  Â  Â facilitate your invitations to friends who you want to invite to join the Service;

â Â  Â  Â enable security features of the Service, such as by sending you security codes via email or SMS, and remembering devices from which you have previously logged in;

â Â  Â  Â understand your needs and interests, and personalize your experience with the Service and our communications; and

Marketing and advertising. Â We, our service providers and our third-party advertising partners may collect and use your personal information for marketing and advertising purposes:

â Â  Â  Â Interest-based advertising. Â We may engage third-party advertising companies and social media companies to display ads on our Service and other online services. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interaction (including the data described in the automatic data collection section above) over time across the Service, our communications and other online services, and use that information to serve online ads that they think will interest you. Â This is called interest-based advertising. We may also share information about our users with these companies to facilitate interest-based advertising to those or similar users on other online platforms.

Compliance and protection. Â We may use your personal information to:

â Â  Â  Â comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal process, such as to respond to subpoenas or requests from government authorities;

â Â  Â  Â protect our, your or othersâ rights, privacy, safety or property (including by making and defending legal claims); 

â Â  Â  Â audit our internal processes for compliance with legal and contractual requirements or our internal policies; 

â Â  Â  Â enforce the terms and conditions that govern the Service; and 

â Â  Â  Â prevent, identify, investigate and deter fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity, including cyberattacks and identity theft. Â 

Events and Promotions. Â 

â Â  Â  Â Event registrations and attendance. We process your personal information to plan and host events or webinars for which you have registered or that you attend, including sending related communications to you;

â Â  Â  Â Contests, programs or promotions.  If you register for a contest, promotion, or a program, we process your personal information to perform our contract with you or where we seek your consent. Some contests, programs and promotions have additional rules containing information about how we will process your personal information.

With your consent.  In some cases, we may specifically ask for your consent to collect, use or share your personal information, such as when required by law. Â 

To create anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data. Â We may create anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data from your personal information and other individuals whose personal information we collect. Â We make personal information into anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data by removing information that makes the data identifiable to you. Â We may use this anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Service and promote our business. Â 

Retention. We generally retain personal information to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes. Â To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Â  

When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we may either delete it, anonymize it, or isolate it from further processing. Â
